first we need .vimrc file in the home directory 
we can set alot of configuration in this file

after setting the configs now we want to add some plugins so we create another file .vimrc.plug also in the home directory
we need a way of linking these to files
it's as follow:

if filereadable(expand("~/.vimrc.plug"))
    source ~/.vimrc.plug
endif

now these two files are connected or linked

in the .vimrc.plug file we need to write the following

	call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
		put your plugins here 
		example:
		Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
	call plug#end()
	
it's important to create the .vim directory in the home directory
and inside the .vim directory we should create another directory called plugged

after adding plugins we should install them by opening vim and then running 
:PlugInstall

!! install the plugins after creating the directories (.vim) (plugged)
